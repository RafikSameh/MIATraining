1- I have some issues during shape detection that it recognize some shapes
that doesnt exit in the photo despite i used many types of blur to overcome any
sharp pixels that could confuse the program 

2- i didn't detect the direction of image cause of shortage of time as i have
exam and final project in my embedded system course and i'm sorry for that
but when i've searched about this , one idea is about using angles to detect the
inclination angle of particular object then by using some condition like
(if angle>90: cv2.puttext"right") it is not accurate im just sayin
